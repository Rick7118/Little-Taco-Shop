# Little-Taco-Shop

This is a html project that i did after watching the html tutorial from dave gray on youtube.I did  not code along but instead i saw the final product and recreated it and i am kind of proud of myself but also kind of bitter because it took me more than 1 year to be finally done with html. I will never watch another html tutorial again.I will keep coding and building and learning as i build. I now know how to look up tags and use chatgpt to help me when i am stuck.

The key to learning is to strive for progress and not perfection.You attain perfection when you put theory into practise
